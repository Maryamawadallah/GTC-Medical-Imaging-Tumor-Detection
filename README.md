#Medical Imaging (Tumor Detection)
Project Overview

This project investigates the application of machine learning techniques to the problem of tumor detection in medical imaging. Using MRI and CT scans as primary data sources, the goal is to design and evaluate an automated system that can reliably classify images into tumor and non-tumor categories. Such a system has the potential to support healthcare professionals by reducing diagnostic time, enhancing accuracy, and providing a consistent second opinion during clinical assessments.

Problem Statement

The interpretation of medical images is both time-intensive and subject to variability among radiologists. Even minor inconsistencies in diagnosis can significantly affect treatment outcomes. Early and accurate tumor detection is therefore essential for effective patient management, yet manual review alone may lead to delays or oversights. This work aims to develop a robust classification model capable of delivering consistent and reliable predictions, thereby addressing some of the limitations of traditional image analysis and supporting more efficient clinical decision-making.
